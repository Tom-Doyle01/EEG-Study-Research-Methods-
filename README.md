This project was completed for my Research Methods class, and it is about seeing whether cognition can affect perception.
Some previous research stated that people perceive moral words more quickly than other words because they are socially important.
We tested this claim by having participants in an EEG read moral, non-moral fashion, and non-fashion words to see how long it took them to process the words.
